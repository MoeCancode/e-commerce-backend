  ## Installation 
  ---
  The installation of this application requires you to have ` mySQL ` installed on your machine. From the root directiory you will need to run the command ` source db/schema.sql `. Next, you can exit out of your sql shell and run the command ` npm run seed ` This will create the database for you and will add some seed data as well.

  Next, you will run the command ` npm start ` and the app will be hosted on a server!
